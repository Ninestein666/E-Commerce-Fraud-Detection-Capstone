# E-Commerce Fraud Detection Capstone Project

This project involves the analysis of e-commerce transactional data to gather meaningful data and insights to help identify fraudulent transactions. The project encompasses data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the creation of data visualizations to support findings.

The dataset contains various features related to transactions, including transaction amount, time, location, method of transaction, devices used, and whether a coupon was applied. The goal is to identify patterns and characteristics of fraudulent transactions to aid in fraud detection.

At a glance:
* Audience: Fraud operations / risk analysts (technical and non-technical)
* Goal: Identify when/where/how fraud occurs, communicate insights clearly, and propose practical controls to minimise fraud risks.
