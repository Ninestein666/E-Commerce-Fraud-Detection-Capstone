    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build a logistic regression model to predict fraudulent transactions.\n",
    "* Turn the patterns we found in EDA (e.g., time, amount, device Ã— channel, country) into a basic risk score using Logistic Regression, so we can automatically flag higher-risk transactions for extra checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "* Python 3.x\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "* Required libraries: pandas, numpy and scikit-learn.\n",
    "* pip install scikit-learn (bash terminal)\n",

    "## What this notebook does\n",
    "- Loads the cleaned dataset.\n",
    "- Prepares features (numeric + one-hot encoded categoricals) in a reproducible pipeline.\n",
    "- Trains a Logistic Regression model with class imbalance handling.\n",
    "- Evaluates performance with ROC AUC and PR AUC, plus precision/recall/F1.\n",
    "- Finds a practical decision threshold (F1-oriented) and shows the confusion matrix.\n",
    "- Lists top positive/negative coefficients to keep the model **explainable.\n",
